# GraduationWorkRetroDemo_Win
This is a Windows Build of the project!
(This repository is mostly useless, since more than half of the files couldn't be uploaded due to them exceeding the 25MB file size limit.)

This gameplay demo serves as part of the experiment for my graduation work project at Howest DAE.
